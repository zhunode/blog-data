    "+ There are still labels involved,but they're generated from the input data,typically using a heuristic algorithm.\n",
    "+ For instance,autoencoders are a well-known instance of self-supervised learing,where the generated targets are the input,unmodified.\n",
    "+ In the same way,trying to predict the next frame in a video,given past frames,or the next word in a text,given previous words, are instances of self-supervised learning.\n",
    "+ Note that the distinction between supervised,self-supervised,and unsupervised learning can be blurry sometimes-these categories are more of a continuum without solid borders.\n",
